== Introduction
From the CCDB-established Working Group, the {iTC-longname} ({iTC-shortname} for short) was formed. The {iTC-shortname} consists of members of Certification Bodies, labs, vendors and academia working together to create requirements for biometric security testing.

To join the {iTC-shortname}, please send an email to {iTC-email} and include the following in your message: Github handle, Name, Affiliation, Contact Info, Experience, etc.

== Current Status
The DSC cPP and SD v1.0 documents have been published and submitted for review by the CCDB for compliance with the CC and CEM.  It can be found on the https://commoncriteriaportal.org/pps/collaborativePP.cfm[Collaborative Protection Profiles (cPP) and Supporting Documents (SD)] page under section "cPPs with SDs that are currently being reviewed by the CCDB for compliance with the CC and CEM" and category of "ICs, Smart Cards and Smart Card-Related Devices and Systems".

The iTC is in the process of transitioning the documents from Word to asciidoc to use GitHub for future revisions. The current versions of these documents have been posted in GitHub and can be seen in the <<v1.0.1DraftDocTable>> table. These versions have minor changes from the original to utilize some capabilities of asciidoc (some internal crosslinking) and a few minor editorial changes that were found during the conversion. These documents are available for preview while the iTC checks the documents for fidelity to the original publication. Once approved these will be published as a 1.0.1 edition.
